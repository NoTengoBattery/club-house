# ClubHouse
This project is a Clubhouse app. The idea is to create an app where the members of the Club can publish posts anonymously. Everyone outside the club should be able to see those posts but not the name of the author unless they are members of the Club.

## Getting Started :
- Clone the repository: `git clone` https://github.com/NoTengoBattery/club-house.git
- Move inside the club-house folder: `cd club-house`
- Run the server: `rails s` or `rails server`
- Run: `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`.
- To see the app on your local machine open your browser and type: `localhost:3000`. Have fun !!!
